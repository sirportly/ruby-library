# Sirportly Ruby API

This library allows you to interact with your Sirportly data using a simple to use
Ruby interface.

**This library is still under development and will change considerably over the next
few releases as new functionality is added.**

## Installation

To install the library, you just need to install the Gem.

```
[sudo] gem install sirportly
```

If you have a Gemfile, you can just include `sirportly` in this and run `bundle install`.

## Setting up a Sirportly Client

All requests to API are made through a `Sirportly::Client` instance which must be initialised
using your API token & secret as shown below. Once this has been initialised, you can use it
to access your database.

```ruby
sirportly = Sirportly::Client.new('the_token', 'the_secret')
```

If you have been provided with an application token to use with user-based authentication you
can set this as follows:

```ruby
Sirportly.application = 'your_application_token'
```

### Custom Domains

If you are using a custom installation of Sirportly, you can set the domain as follows:

```ruby
Sirportly.domain = "https://my-domain.com"
```

## Creating a ticket

You can create tickets within your Sirportly system with a few commands. It's important to note that
creating a new ticket is a two step process - firstly, you need to create a `Ticket` record and then
you need to post your initial update using the `post_update` method on your newly created ticket.

```ruby
# Create the skeleton ticket
properties = {
  :brand => 'Sirportly',
  :department => 'Sales',
  :status => 'New',
  :priority => 'Normal',
  :subject => 'A new sales enquiry',
  :name => 'My New Customer',
  :email => 'customeremail@theirdomain.com'
}
ticket = sirportly.create_ticket(properties)    #=> A Sirportly::Ticket instance

# Now add the first update to this ticket
update = ticket.post_update(:message => "I would like some more info about your product", :customer => ticket.customer)
```

If an error occurs, you will receive a Sirportly::Errors::ValidationError exception. There are many
other properties which can be passed to the `create_ticket` method which are not documented here. Take
a look at the [API documentation](http://www.sirportly.com/docs/api-specification/tickets/submitting-a-new-ticket)
for more information about the options available.

## Accessing Tickets

You can access ticket information directly through the Ruby interface.

```ruby
sirportly.tickets                   #=> A set of all tickets (paginated)
sirportly.ticket('AB-123123')       #=> Returns a Sirportly::Ticket object for the passed reference
sirportly.ticket_search('example')  #=> A set of all tickets matching 'example' from the search
```

You can also access tickets through filter objects.

```ruby
filter = sirportly.filters.first    #=> A Sirportly::Filter object
filter.tickets                      #=> A Sirportly::DataSet of objects (paginated)
filter.tickets(:page => 2)          #=> The second page of tickets
filter.tickets(:user => 'adam')     #=> The tickets as if being accessed by 'adam'
```

## Changing ticket properties

If you wish to change properties of a ticket, you can use the `update` method. This method behaves
exactly the same as the corresponding API method and further details can be found in the
[documentation](https://atech.sirportly.com/knowledge/4/api-specification/tickets/changing-ticket-properties).
You can pass strings, IDs or `Sirportly::DataObject` objects as values.

```ruby
ticket = sirportly.ticket('AB-123123')

# Change a ticket status
ticket.update(:status => "waiting for staff")

# Change a ticket priority
ticket.update(:priority => "low")

# Change multiple attributes
ticket.update(:team => "1st line support", :user => "dave")
```

Once an update has been carried out, the original ticket object will be updated to include the new properties.

## Posting updates to tickets

Posting updates to tickets is a simple affair and the `post_update` method on a `Sirportly::Ticket`
will accept the same parameters as defined in the [documentation](http://www.sirportly.com/docs/api-specification/tickets/posting-an-update).

As you will see from the examples below, you can pass a `Sirportly::User` instance to `user` and a
`Sirportly::Customer` instance to `customer` although strings are perfectly acceptable too.

The `post_update` method will return a `Sirportly::TicketUpdate` instance and the new update will
be added to the `updates` array on the original ticket.

```ruby
ticket = sirportly.ticket('AB-123123')

# To post a system message without a user
ticket.post_update(:message => "My Example Message")

# To post an update as the ticket customer
ticket.post_update(:message => "My Example Message", :customer => ticket.customer)

# To post an update as a user
user = sirportly.user('adam')
ticket.post_update(:message => "My Example Message", :user => user)

# To post an update and e-mail it to the customer
ticket.post_update(:message => "My Example", :user => 'adam', :outbound_address => 'support@yourdomain.com')

# To post a private update as a user
ticket.post_update(:message => "Private Msg", :private => true, :user => 'charlie')
```

## Getting Attachment Content

This method allows you to download the contents of an attachment on a ticket.

* ```ticket``` - the REFERENCE for the ticket which the attachment belongs to
* ```attachment``` - the ID of the attachment which you wish to download

```ruby
sirportly.attachment(ticket: '012345', attachment: '012345')
```

## Executing Macros

If you wish to execute one of your macros on a ticket, you can use the `run_macro` method
which accepts the ID or name of the macro you wish to execute. If executed successfully,
it will return true and the original ticket properties will be updated. If it fails, an
exception will be raised or the method will return false.

```ruby
ticket = sirportly.ticket('AB-123123')
ticket.run_macro('Mark as waiting for staff')
````

## Adding follow ups

Adding to follow ups to tickets can be achieved by executing the `add_follow_up` method on a
`Sirportly::Ticket` instance.

```ruby
ticket = sirportly.ticket('AB-123123')
ticket.add_follow_up(:actor => 'adam', :status => 'resolved', :run_at => '2 days from now') #=> true
```

The `run_at` attribute should be a timestamp as outlined on our
[date/time formatting page](http://www.sirportly.com/docs/api-specification/date-time-formatting) in
the API documentation.

## Creating a user

You can create users (staff members) via the API.

```ruby
user_properties = {
  :first_name    => 'John',
  :last_name     => 'Particle',
  :email_address => 'john@testcompany.com',
  :admin_access  => true
}

user = sirportly.create_user(user_properties)  #=> A Sirportly::User instance
```

There are other attributes available, which can be viewed on the [API docs](http://www.sirportly.com/docs/api-specification/users/create-new-user).

You do not need to create individual customers. These are created automatically on ticket and ticket update creation.

## Knowledge Bases

Knowledge bases hold static pages of information.

```ruby
# Get all knowledge bases
sirportly.knowledge_bases.first.attributes
=> {"id"=>47, "name"=>"Test", "format"=>"markdown", "all_teams"=>true}

# Or by individually by ID
sirportly.knowledge_base(42)
=> #<Sirportly::KnowledgeBase:0x007fb8a390a7c8>
```

If fetched individually, a knowledge base object contains all the pages belonging to the knowledge base.

```ruby
knowledge_bases = sirportly.knowledge_bases.first
kb_with_pages = sirportly.knowledge_base(knowledge_bases.first.attributes['id'])
```

### Knowledge Base Pages

A page object contains an array of child pages.

```ruby
kb = sirportly.knowledge_base(kb_id)
kb.tree                           #=> Array of KnowledgeBasePage objects
page = kb.page('path/to/page')    #=> A KnowledgeBasePage object
page.children                     #=> Array of KnowledgeBasePage objects

```

The API does not support knowledge base creation, but it does support create page creation.

```ruby
kb = sirportly.knowledge_bases.first
kb.create_page(:title => 'My Title', :content => 'Content here')  #=> #<Sirportly::Page:0x007ff233970d88>
```

TODO: Child page creation.

## Accessing Static Data Objects

The Sirportly API provides access to all the data objects stored in your Sirportly database.
At the current time, these cannot be edited through the API.

```ruby
sirportly.statuses                  #=> Set of all statuses as Sirportly::Status objects
sirportly.priorities.first          #=> A Sirportly::Priority object for the first record

sirportly.brands.first.departments  #=> Array of Sirportly::Department objects

sirportly.user('adam')              #=> Returns a Sirportly::User object
sirportly.customer('Dave Smith')    #=> Returns a Sirportly::Customer object
```

You can access the following objects using this method: brands, departments, escalation_paths,
filters, priorities, slas, statuses, teams and users.

## Pagination

Some results from the API are paginated as outlined below. By default, it will always
return the first page.

```ruby
users = sirportly.users(:page => 1)

users.each do |user|
  user.is_a?(Sirportly::User)     #=> true
  user.full_name                  #=> "Adam Cooke"
  user.teams                      #=> Array of Sirportly::Team objects
  user.teams.first.name           #=> "First Line Support"
end

users.page              #=> 1
users.total_records     #=> 35
users.pages             #=> 2
users.offset            #=> 0
```

If a result set is not paginated, the methods outlined above will be nil. Pagination will only occur
at the top level of results and does not happen on arrays within objects.

## Executing SPQL queries

Sirportly includes a powerful query language called SPQL (SirPortly Query Language) which allows you
to query your ticket data through the API. This is primarily used to generate reports however can also
be used to return data for your own purposes.

```ruby
query = sirportly.spql('SELECT COUNT, brand.name FROM tickets GROUP BY brand.name')
query.fields          #=> ["COUNT", "brand.name"]
query.results         #=> [[123, "Appli"], [456, "aTech Media"], [789, "aTech Telecoms"], [123, "Sirportly"]]
query.query           #=> "SELECT COUNT, brand.name FROM tickets GROUP BY brand.name"
query.class.to_s      #=> Sirportly::SPQLQuery
```

If you execute a query which is invalid, a `Sirportly::Errors::ValidationError` will be raised with some
information about the error.

```ruby
query = sirportly.spql('SELECT COUNT FROM non_existent_table')
Sirportly::Errors::ValidationError: ["Invalid FROM table specified"]
```
